# HackRPI19: Disaster Recovery Donations

## Authors

Destin Yee, Rahul Jain

## Motivation

We wanted to enable people to have an easy way to donate to reputable & established charities that support people in need during various natural disasters.

## Technologies & Tools

We used python programs to web scrape lists of disasters and some available charities. In addition, we used angular and Rest API's to create a functional website.

## Challenges

This was our first hackathon so we didn't have a lot of experience going in. We spent a lot of time researching how to use a web scraper and finding suitable websites to gather data from. We also spent time looking at how to create a functional website with angular.
